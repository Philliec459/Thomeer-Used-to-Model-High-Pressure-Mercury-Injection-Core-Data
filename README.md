# Thomeer-Used-to-Model-High-Pressure-Mercury-Injection-Data
In this repository we provide the python code used to Closure correct and model High Pressure Mercury Injection (HPMI) data using the Thomeer hyperbola.

This is the GitHub repository for the python code used to model High Pressure Mercury Injection (HPMI) Core data employing the Thomeer hyperbola to model the Thomeer Capillary Pressure parameters as shown below. We use this software to develop our own Core Characterization Reservoir-Specific calibration database for your next reservoir characterization project.
